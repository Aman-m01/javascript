// AjAX --> Asynchronous javascript and XML.
// it is a set of web development techniques 
// using many web technologies on the "client side"
// to create asynchronous web application 

// with AJAX web application can send and retrieve 
// data from server asynchronously(in the background)
// without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page 

// we don't use data in XML format  anymore 
// we use JSON now 

// we have three most common way to create and send request to server 
// 1> xmlHTTPRequest (old way of doing )
//2> Fetch API (new way of doing)**
// 3> axios (this is a third party library)**
