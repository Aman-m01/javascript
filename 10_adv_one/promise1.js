 // promise in js
 // promise is a result object that is used to handle asynchronous operations
 // it can be in one of the three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected
 // pending: initial state, where operation has not started yet
 // fulfilled: successful operation, where promise is resolved
 // rejected: failed operation, where promise is rejected
