--> Array.from(value) is used to convert the element into array.
--> to replace the inner html of the webpage we use console and use Document.getElementById('ID_name').innerHTML = <h1> data</h1>

to initialize the content we use text value textContent.
--> innerText show those text which is visible but textContent show all the text which may be hide by css property.

--> querySelector('h1') -> it only select the first h1 on the page.
--> querySelectorAll('h1') --> it select all the h1 of the page.

--> querySelector are also used with all the selectors like id , class and other 
--> document.querySelector('input[type="password"]') used for select the input selectors

--> in nodeList we maximum use the foreach loops. map doesn't work. map can work if we can convert into an array.

note--> chain the htmlCollection into array and then apply the for each loop and some actions.

--> .children property is used to find the children vslues in html collection

e.preventDefault is used to stop the default action --> used in form - here we use the submit addEventListener
